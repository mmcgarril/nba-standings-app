NBA API APP 2

This app retrives live data to display current NBA standings in the browser. First front-end project that I'm sharing to Github. I wanted to work on the following things:

-routes
-components
-state
-fetching a public api

Still need to add:
-a function to set the current year, I hard-coded it to be 2024 for now (the season is 2024-2025 so the api is looking for the start-year)

notes:
-the 'games behind' data returned by the api was problematic so I came up with a function to calculate using wins and losses from data (which is accurate)
-most recently added a dropdown to change the season to be displayed
